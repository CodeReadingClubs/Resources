# The starter kit

Use these 3 session kits to get your club off the ground.

Each folder contains:
 - README.md - instructions for the facilitator
 - agenda.md - an agenda for the session to share with participants
 - code.pdf - a pdf of code to read together in the session, extracted as a whole single file

You can use these sessions to get your club off the ground.
