# The starter kit

You can use these sessions to get your club off the ground.

* [Session 1 resources](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/tree/trunk/StarterKit/Session1)
* [Session 2 resources](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/tree/trunk/StarterKit/Session2)
* [Session 3 resources](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/tree/trunk/StarterKit/Session3)
* [Session 4 and beyond resources](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/tree/trunk/StarterKit/Session4-and-beyond)

They should help get your club off to a strong start. After that, use feedback from your group to adapt to their needs.
