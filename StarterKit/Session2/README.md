# Your second code reading club!

* This session should take about an hour and 15 minutes.
* You can have the same facilitator as the first session or give someone else the responsibility.
* The clubs are designed so that you should not need any special skills or knowledge to facilitate.
* The most important thing to remember is keep your group on track. If people stray into too much detail about the code early on, or one person is dominating the conversation, step in.
* Make sure everyone in your group feels safe to speak. No one should be made to feel dumb or clever.
* The exercises are designed to be self contained, but in progressive order, so you can choose which one's to includ in each session, but keep them in the same relative order.
* Our [session 2 agenda](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session2/agenda.md) does not inclde the Summary section from session one. That's because we often find an 'ah ha' moment happens at some point for everyone in the group anyway, and we like to make time for more interesting discussions about how we are understanding the code rather than what it is doing.
* Remember, it's best if the participants do not look at the code before the session, but they'll need to arrive with a copy (printed or digital) ready for marking up.
