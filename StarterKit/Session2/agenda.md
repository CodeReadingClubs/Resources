# Code Reading Club - Session 2 agenda

## TOTAL time (75 mins)

You will need:

- a printed copy of the code for the club and coloured pens, crayons or pencils

    -or- 

- an electronic means of scribbling on a code PDF (e.g. a tablet and tablet pen)

## Why are we doing this?

Take a few minutes to think about times when you recalled something from the club. This is important because it will help you apply your new skills day-to-day if you hear how others are doing so. It also makes it easier for your group to see that the club sessions have value.

### (2 mins) Independently - Reflect

Note a time the past few weeks when:
* you used one of the techniques from the club in your work

    -or-

* you used information learned about code in your work

    -or-

* if you can't think of any, use this time to write down a hope or worry related to the club


### (3 mins) Together - Discuss

* Give everyone a chance to read out their experiences
* Use the remaining time to discuss collectively

## First glance

The goal of this exercise is to practice to get a first impression of code and to act upon that. We all have different instincts and strategies for where to start when faced with a new piece of code. It doesn't matter how trivial you think the first and second things you noticed are.

### (1 min) Independently - Glance at the code

It's important that is an immediate reaction.

* Right away, note down the first thing that catches your eye.
* Then note down the second thing that catches your eye.
* Take the remainder of the minute to think about why you noticed those things first.

### (5 mins) Together - Discuss the results

Talk about why things might have jumped out for different people.

* How do those initial observations help with deciding what to look at next?
* What lines or facts or concepts were chosen by everyone versus by only a few people?

Reflect also on what kind of knowledge you used in this exercise:

* Knowledge of the domain, of the programming language? Of a framework?
* What knowledge do you think might be needed to better understand this code?

## Code structure

The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to *do* when looking at new code for the first time. New code can be scary, doing something will help! Digital annotation can take a bit longer than on paper. Leave time for your group members to settle on a technique that works for them.

### (10 mins) Independently - Examine structure

Variables
* Go through the code and circle all variables in red
* Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Function / method calls
* Go through the code and circle all methods in blue 
* Then draw a link between methods and their invocations

Instantiation 
* Go through the code and circle all instances of classes in green 
* Then draw a link between classes and their instances

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss the results

* Did anyone have trouble deciding what constituted a variable, function or class?
* What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
* What parts of the code seem to warrant more attention?

## Content
The goal of these exercises is to start to think about which lines in the code define it's essence, have the biggest impact or need to be paid close attention to. Start by examining the names of things. This is one method for discovering how the code fits together and it's intentions. It can help make the identifying important lines exercises less intimidating.

### (5 mins) Together - Note down all variable/class/method names

As a group, go through the code mechanically and create a list of all identifier names in the snippet. This can be done with one person scribing while others call out. If you have done the "examine structure" exercise before, this should be relatively quick and easy; but sometimes, you will need short disussions to agree things.

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss

* What can we learn from these names?
* Which names are related to each other, from the names only?
* Are there names that are ambiguous when looked at without context?

### (10 mins) Independently - Identify most important lines

Briefly discuss what it means to be important as a group (if you want to)

* then, identify the 5 lines you consider most important

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss

Discuss in the group:
* lines covered by many people?
* lines named but not by a lot of people
* Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.

## Reflect on the session
If you have time, it's helpful to wrap up the session with a little reflection

### (5 mins) Together - note down things about the session

* that went well or felt good
* you want to try to do differenly next time because they didn't work or felt bad
