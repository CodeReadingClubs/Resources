## Design your agenda with selected [exercises](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/exercises.md)

Keep practicing with the Basic Exercises and when you feel ready, try out some of the Advanced Exercises on a piece of code you're familiar with from a previous session.

## Grab some code from our [suggested code snippets](https://https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session4-and-beyond/code-snippets) or find your own
