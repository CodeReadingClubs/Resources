# You've run 3 sessions, now you're a pro!

## Design your agenda with selected [exercises](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/exercises.md)

Keep practicing with the Basic Exercises and when you feel ready, try out some of the Advanced Exercises on a piece of code you're familiar with from a previous session.

## Grab some code from our [suggested code snippets](https://https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session4-and-beyond/code-snippets) or find your own

There is no bad choice - even html can be a conversation starter. Use this [pdf generator for github code](https://pdf-maker.netlify.app) or download one we made earlier:
