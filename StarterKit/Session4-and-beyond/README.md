# You've run 3 sessions, now you're a pro!

## Design your agenda with selected [exercises](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/exercises.md). Keep practicing with the Basic Exercises and when you feel ready, try out some of the Advanced Exercises on a piece of code you're familiar with from a previous session.

## Grab some code from our [suggested code snippets](https://https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session4-and-beyond/code-snippets) or find your own. There is no bad choice - even html can be a conversation starter.

## If you are finding the sessions beneficial, get in touch and spread the word

- Invite some developers from outside your group or organisation to your club
- [Let us know](mailto:katja@neontribe.co.uk) how you're finding it or if you have any ideas that will help make these clubs more beneficial for everyone.
