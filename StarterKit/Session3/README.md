# Your third code reading club!

* As with session 2 we're changing up the content section for [session 3 agenda](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session3/agenda.md) and keeping the rest the same.
* You'll start to discover which exercises are working well for your group or different samples of code.
* Remember, it's best if the participants do not look at the code before the session, but they'll need to arrive with a copy (printed or digital) ready for marking up.

## Where the code.pdf came from

* It's best if the participants don't know anything about the code before the session starts.
* It's often fun to do a big reveal of where the code came from, if it relies on a framework and even sometimes, what language it is.

### Info for facilitator:

On of our groups was inspired by [yarn's choice to use prolog for constraints](https://yarnpkg.com/features/constraints) and we wanted to see what it was like.

Usually we steer away from using example code in the reading sessions since the point of them is to practice reading production code in the wild (with all of its flaws); but for obscure languages, an example file can be the easiest to discuss. Getting your group through this session will prove that you are prepared to tackle anything.

This session 3 code is written in prolog for for teaching logic in prolog and can be found: [Anniepoo/prolog-examples](https://github.com/Anniepoo/prolog-examples/blob/master/children.pl)
