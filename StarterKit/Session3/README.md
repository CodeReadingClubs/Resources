# Your third code reading club!

* As with session 2 we're changing up the content section for [session 3 agenda](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session3/agenda.md) and keeping the rest the same.
* You'll start to discover which exercises are working well for your group or different samples of code.
* Remember, it's best if the participants do not look at the code before the session, but they'll need to arrive with a copy (printed or digital) ready for marking up.
