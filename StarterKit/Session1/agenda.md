# Code Reading Club - Session 1 agenda

You will need:

- a printed copy of the code for the club and coloured pens, crayons or pencils
-or- 
- an electronic means of scribbling on a code PDF (e.g. a tablet and tablet pen)

## Why are we doing this?

Take a few minutes to talk about your motivation for doing the club. This is important because it will help you support each other and make it more likely that your group will feel that the club sessions have value for them.

### (2 mins) Independently - Note down one thing about the club:

* that you are looking forward to or excited about
* that you are worried or confused about

### (3 mins) Together - Discuss

* Give everyone a chance to read out their hopes and fears
* Use the remaining time to discuss collectively what you want to get out of the club

## First glance

The goal of this exercise is to practice to get a first impression of code and to act upon that.

### (1 min) Independently - Look at the code at a glance

It's important that is an immediate reaction, so really not more than 1 minute.

### (2 mins) Independently - Try to answer these questions:

* What is the first thing that catches your eye? Why is that?
* What is the *second* thing that you see? Why?
* Are these two things (variables, classes, programming concepts) related?


### (7 mins) Together - Discuss the results

* What lines or facts or concepts were chosen by everyone versus by only a few people?

Reflect also on what kind of knowledge you used in this exercise:

* Knowledge of the domain, of the programming language? Of a framework?
* What knowledge do you think might be needed to better understand this code?

## Code structure

### (10 mins) Independently - Examine structure
The goal of this exercise is to be a concrete thing to *do* when looking at new code for the first time. New code can be scary, doing something will help!

Color variables
* Go through the code and circle all variables in red
* Then draw a link between variables and their uses

Color method/function calls
* Go through the code and circle all methods in blue 
* Then draw a link between methods and their invocations

Instantiation 
* Go through the code and circle all instances of classes in green 
* Then draw a link between classes and their instances

### (10 mins) Together - Discuss the results

* What patterns are visible from the colors and links only?
* What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors?

## Content

### Identify most important lines (10 mins)
Briefly discuss what it means to be important as a group (if you want to), and then independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important.

### Discussion (10 mins)

Discuss in the group:
* lines covered by many people?
* lines named but not by a lot of people
* Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.

### Summarize in less than 10 sentences individually (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences

### Discussion (10 mins)
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
