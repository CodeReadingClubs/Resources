# Your first code reading club!

* Set aside an hour and a half for this club. 
* Your subsequent sessions can be shorter, but it's good to leave enough time to go through things in more detail when you first start.
* It's important to leave enough time for everyone to get involved and have an understanding.
* The facilitator should familiarise themself with the [session 1 agenda](https://github.com/CodeReadingClubs/Resources/blob/trunk/StarterKit/Session1/agenda.md) before the session, but everyone else just needs to turn up. It's helpful for everyone to be able to see the agenda during the session, so either send the participants a copy or share one online.
* It's best if the participants do not look at the code before the session, but they'll need to arrive with a copy (printed or digital) ready for marking up.

## Where the code.pdf came from

* It's best if the participants don't know anything about the code before the session starts.
* It's often fun to do a big reveal of where the code came from, if it relies on a framework and even sometimes, what language it is.

Info for facilitator:
 This session 1 code is written in Swift for the messaging app Signal and can be found: [sinalapp/Signal-iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/blob/master/Signal/src/Models/PhoneNumberValidator.swift)
