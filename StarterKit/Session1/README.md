# Your first code reading club!

* Set aside an hour and a half for this club. 
* Your subsequent sessions can be shorter, but it's good to leave enough time to go through things in more detail wheh you first start.
* It's important to leave enough time for everyone to get involved and have an understanding.

## Where the code.pdf came from

* It's best if the participants don't know anything about the code before the session starts.
* It's often fun to do a big reveal of where the code came from, if it relies on a framework and even sometimes, what language it is.

Info for facilitator:
 This session 1 code is written in Swift for the messaging app Signal and can be found: [sinalapp/Signal-iOS](https://github.com/signalapp/Signal-iOS/blob/master/Signal/src/Models/PhoneNumberValidator.swift)
