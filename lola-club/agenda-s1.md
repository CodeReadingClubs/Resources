# Code Reading Club agenda

## Club goals and expectations
- Intro code reading club concept
- Intro people in the group including experience & types of programming
- Set sessions. Frequency and length.
- Discuss goals and expectations of group members

### Interaction with code (10 mins)
1. Colour1 the variables - circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses
1. Colour2 the method/ function calls - circle and draw links between declarations and calls
1. Colour3 the classes - circle and draw links between classes and their instances

#### Discuss the results (10 mins)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors and indentations only?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors and indentation?

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)
1. Define what it means to be important and independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

#### Discuss (10 mins)
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
[Save the last word for me protocol](https://lead.nwp.org/knowledgebase/save-the-last-word-for-me-protocol/)

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences
1. Discuss in the group
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing


## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly

## Reminder to note for reflection next session
- Note a time the past 2 weeks when you used one of the techniques from the club in your work
- Note a time the past 2 weeks when you used information learned about code in your work
