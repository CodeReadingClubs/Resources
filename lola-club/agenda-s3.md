# Code Reading Club agenda

## Reflection (5 mins)
- Between sessions, note times when you notice that code reading club has helped you in your other projects or conversations.

### Interaction with code (10 mins)
1. Colour1 the variables - circle and draw links between instatiation and all uses
1. Colour2 the method/ function calls - circle and draw links between declarations and calls
1. Colour3 the classes - circle and draw links between classes and their instances

#### Discuss the results (10 mins)
1. What patterns are visible from the colors?
1. What parts of the code warrant more attention based on the colors?

### Content

#### Identify (10 mins)
1. If necessary, define / remind in group a meaning of importance
1. Independently identify the 5 lines you consider most important
1. Note down which line numbers people selected individually

#### Discuss (15 mins)
Take turns in the group, and let every member talk about the code for 30 seconds (or less/more, could also be one sentence each). Try to add new information and not repeat things that have been said, and repeat until people do not know new things anymore.
[Save the last word for me protocol](https://lead.nwp.org/knowledgebase/save-the-last-word-for-me-protocol/)
1. Discuss in the group:
- lines covered by many people?
- lines named but not by a lot of people
- Agree less than 10 of the most important lines

#### Summarize in less than 10 sentences (10 mins)
1. Independently write down the essence of the code in a few sentences
1. Discuss in the group
- topics covered by many vs few
- strategies used to create the summary (e.g. method names, documentation, variable names, prior knowledge of system)
1. Create a summary together
1. Compare the summary with the available documentation (inside and outside the code)
- identify differences and similarities between the groups findings and the existing

## Wash up (5 mins)
- What worked well
- What worked badly
